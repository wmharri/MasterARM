# MasterARM

This program implements the game Mastermind in ARM Assembly. Originally a class project, written with a teammate, I will be using it to practice calling assembly from C.

## TO DO

I plan to overhaul the user interface by writing it in C. I also plan to correct bugs I discovered in the game after submitting it for a grade.
